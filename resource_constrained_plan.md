## Memory Management Strategy

### Model Size Constraints (A100-40GB)
- **Llama-2-7B**: Safe (uses ~8-12GB for training)
- **Llama-2-13B**: Manageable (uses ~15-20GB for training)
- **Llama-2-70B**: AVOID (requires 50+ GB)

### Memory Optimization Techniques
1. **Gradient checkpointing**: Enable for larger models
2. **CPU offloading**: Move inactive blocks to CPU
3. **Mixed precision**: Use bfloat16 for non-quantized parts
4. **Batch size reduction**: Use gradient accumulation
5. **Sequential block training**: Keep only one block on GPU

### Training Configuration
```bash
# Memory-efficient settings for A100-40GB
--batch_size 1              # Reduce from default 2
--gradient_accumulation 4   # Maintain effective batch size
--max_memory "35GiB"        # Leave 5GB buffer
--offload_to_disk          # Use disk for large datasets
--real_quant               # Pack weights immediately
```

### Baseline Comparisons
- **Essential**: EfficientQAT, GPTQ, AWQ
- **Optional**: OmniQuant, AutoRound (if memory permits)
- **Skip**: Vector quantization methods (QuIP#, AQLM)

- **Focus**: Efficiency gains rather than absolute accuracy

## Alternative Low-Cost Research Directions

If the main plan seems too ambitious, consider these simpler alternatives:

### Option A: "LayerWise-QAT" (4 weeks)
- Focus ONLY on sensitivity-ordered training
- Deep analysis of layer sensitivity patterns
- Comprehensive ablation on ordering strategies
- Lower risk, moderate novelty

### Option B: "Progressive-QAT" (6 weeks)
- Focus on curriculum bit-width learning
- Add distillation during bit transitions
- Study convergence properties
- Novel training dynamics analysis

### Option C: "Efficient-Hardware-QAT" (6 weeks)
- Focus on hardware optimization
- Power-of-2 scales + fused kernels
- Comprehensive hardware benchmarking
- Systems-focused contribution

## Success Probability

### Main Plan (3 contributions): **80-85%**
- High chance of 2/3 components working well
- Medium chance of all 3 working perfectly
- Publication-worthy even with 2/3 success

### Alternative Plans: **90-95%**
- Single-focus approaches much safer
- Easier to debug and validate
- Lower novelty but higher success rate

**Recommendation**: Start with main plan, be ready to pivot to single-focus if needed by Week 4.
